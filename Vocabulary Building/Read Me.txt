This code helps to exercise daily vocabulary building. The German words in file 1000.csv are selected from the first 1000 of A Frequency Dictionary of German: Core Vocabulary for Learners by Tschirner and MÃ¶hring. I purchased it on Amazon, and recommend it to you (https://www.amazon.com/Frequency-Dictionary-German-Vocabulary-Learners-dp-1138659789/dp/1138659789/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).
