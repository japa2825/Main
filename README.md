Hi everyone, this Jack P. A. I have studied pure math for 10+ years, and currently work in the financial industry. I want to find a better job and relocate to a more comfortable place to live.

I like to read and write. The first few uploads are my recent Python codes that I wrote for entertainment. Please use at your own discretion. I may also write some math articles just for fun. 

You may contact me via email, the address being "my-GitHub-ID at proton dot me".
